# swiftmix
SwiftMiX is for Windows PCs and laptops. It is a music player based around two Windows Media Player Active-X controls. SwiftMiX auto-fades songs between two lists and handles inport and export of most playlist formats.

## requirements;
I have included the requisite dlls and resourses in zip-files. Read Readme.txt...
To build both SwiftMiX and its MSI installer, set the solution target to "Release" and "x86" then right-click "SwiftMiX Installer" and choose "Rebuild". The output msi installer will go to the ".\SwiftMiX Installer\Release" folder.
